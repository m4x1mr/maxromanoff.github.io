                    Subscribe & Earn explored whether loyalty points could incentivize recurring grocery purchases.
                    Early results showed that customers consistently preferred immediate discounts over
                    subscription-based rewards.

                <h2 class="heading">Context</h2>
                <p>
                    PC Express is the grocery e-commerce platform for Loblaw, serving over 3 million active customers
                    and generating nearly $2B in annual revenue. Alongside it sits PC Optimum, the largest loyalty
                    program in Canada.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subscribe & Earn set out to connect these two powerful systems. The idea was to reward customers
                    with PC Optimum points when they committed to recurring purchases of frequently bought items—every
                    week, two weeks, or month. The hypothesis was that subscriptions could increase retention and repeat
                    purchase behavior by removing friction from habitual shopping.

            </section>

            <section class="content-block copy">
                <h2 class="heading">Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    I led the design for the program on the UI side, and worked closely with Operations teams to
                    understand impacts to existing systems and design new processes. I kicked off this work by looking
                    into competitor programs and designing flows for how this could work in PC Express. Though usability
                    testing brought opportunities where we can improve, constraints from the operations side told us the
                    boundaries we could work in.

            <!-- CHALLENGES -->
            <section class="content-block copy">
                <h2 class="heading">Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    Based on existing business rules, our system only allowed one open order at a time to boost AOV,
                    alongside a $35 minimum — if a user already placed an order to arrive for next week, and tried to
                    place another one right now to arrive for tomorrow, those items would be added to the open order for
                    next week. Which means unless all subscriptions had the same set frequency, and they added up to
                    over $35, the user wouldn’t receive their items.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, since only one order could be open at once, we had a risk that a user could have a
                    subscription overlap with a regular order or another subscription with a different frequency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I first designed a process to allow customers to merge their subscription order with their regular
                    weekly shop if their subscription was coming up soon. I then designed for “consolidation” where once
                    you set up your first subscription, all future subscriptions are automatically scheduled to arrive
                    on the same day of the week.

                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    Two months after launch, adoption was well below expectations. Roughly 600 customers had an active
                    subscription compared to an expectation of 70,000 in the first year. About 1,100 subscriptions were
                    active versus an expected 60,000 subscription orders annually.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While longer-term metrics like retention required more time to evaluate, early signals were clear.
                    Customers understood the feature and could use it successfully, but consistently chose sale pricing
                    over committing to subscriptions for future rewards.

                <p>
                    Subscribe & Earn reinforced that strong UX can’t compensate for a weak value proposition. In
                    grocery, immediate savings mattered more than deferred loyalty benefits, even when flexibility was
                    built into the system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In hindsight, deeper validation earlier—particularly around customer motivation and
                    cost-to-serve—could have reduced risk. A smaller experiment, such as automatically adding frequently
                    purchased items to cart without a subscription commitment, may have tested the underlying behavior
                    before introducing fulfillment complexity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although outcomes fell short, the work clarified where subscriptions do and don’t make sense in
                    grocery e-commerce, and informed future roadmap decisions with a clearer understanding of customer
                    tradeoffs.
