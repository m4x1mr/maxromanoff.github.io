                Redesigning the Sharing Process on Spotify

                Side-Project<br>

            </h3>
            <p>
                <br>
                <br>
                Back in early 2019, I found myself on a roll, finding great music left, right and centre. As with
                many people, I wanted to share what I found with friends that I knew had the same taste. It's during
                this "spree" that I realized how annoying it was to share music on Spotify; constantly having to go
                through iMessage, type in the name of one of my contacts, send it, and repeat this for however many
                songs I was sending or people I was sending it to. I knew that there had to be a better way.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although I wasn't working at Spotify, I wanted to see if I could solve this problem through a
                side-project. As a result, I designed a prototype that would keep sharing
                within the Spotify app, and store shared items in playlists/ lists for ease of access.

                Spotify's Past Attempt at Sharing
            </h2>

            <img src="img/Spotify-inbox.webp" alt="">

            <p>
                While researching better ways of sharing, I came across the fact that Spotify used to include an
                in-app messaging feature. Users could send messages to each other and then access the music that
                was sent to them without exiting the app. I soon realized I was one of many that was surprised that this
                even existed, yet wasn't surprised that this feature was deprecated due to low-engagement.
            </p>

        <section>
            <p>
                Though many users praised the fact that it made sharing music quick and easy, and that it helped them
                keep track of all the music that was shared to them, I found many complaints about Spotify's actual
                implementation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Users mentioned that due to the lack of notifications (when songs are received) and the feature being
                buried in their settings, many didn't even realize this functionality existed. Other insight I got was
                that some users had multiple group-chats in other apps (i.e: Facebook, WhatsApp), and questioned why
                they'd need another dedicated inbox.
                <br>
                <br>
                Though the benefits included sharing without leaving the app, and being able to easily keep track of
                shared music, my findings led me to believe that in-app messaging wasn't the way to go. From here I
                wondered,
                how might Spotify keep the convenience of sharing in-app, without messaging, meanwhile still making
                shared items more accessible to users to
                improve engagement with this feature?
            </p>

        <section>
            <h2>
                An Alternative Way of Sharing
            </h2>

            <p>
                Despite deprecating their in-app messaging feature, Spotify did include their own integration into iOS'
                Messages app. Though not my primary focus, I decided to look into this to see if it addresses any of the
                problems I
                noticed with the original in-app messaging approach.
                <br>
                <br>
                After forcing myself to use it,
                my conclusion (and assumption) was that this method didn't follow a Spotify listener's mindset, and
                actually fared worse when looking at convenience and saving songs; in the end, it didn't solve either of
                the sharing or
                receiving issues that I was going after.
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <h3>
                Sharing
            </h3>
            <p>
                For sharing a song, the user is greeted with an empty search field, prompting
                them to remember whatever song they were listening to and search for it and send it. From a usability
                standpoint, users are left inconvenienced as they are limited to only choosing songs and aren't given
                "hints" such as previously played songs. Just to add on the psychological aspect (and my own
                experiences), I only want to share music to friends when I, myself, am listening to music. With the
                Messages integration, I would need to be messaging someone and take the time to locate the song by name,
                and then share it; this to me is unrealistic.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Receiving
            </h3>
            <p>
                On the receiving end, the user would see a link similar to that of the traditional sharing method,
                except with the Spotify logo on the top-left. Upon clicking it, rather than being taken to the app, they
                are shown a preview of the song with a 30-second snippet. This adds another barrier to the receiving end
                of having to click again to access the full song.

            <h2>
                Understanding the Current Sharing Problem
            </h2>
            <p>
                Knowing the backstory of sharing on Spotify, I wanted to move forward and further explore what
                sharing is now; I did this by speaking to a few friends that I knew were frequent users of Spotify.
                With these informal interviews, my main goal was to find out how they felt about sharing outside of
                Spotify, and whether it was any better than in-app.
                <br>
                <br>
                Long-story short, it was not better.
                <br>
                <br>
                My findings basically fell into 3 groups, being around sharing, receiving and comparisons to other
                apps.
            </p>

            <img src="img/Spotify-Whiteboard.webp" alt="">

            <p>
                With sharing from the Spotify app, the consensus seemed to be that the process was too long. Users
                mentioned that they would need to go through multiple menus just to find the sharing screen, and then
                would have to leave the app and send the song (the same issue I was facing initially). With the
                flow-chart below, the bulk of the steps for sharing come from interacting with an external app.
            </p>

            <img src="img/Spotify-Flow Chart.webp" alt="">


            <p>
                With receiving, however,
                the biggest problem was losing track of the music. This is where I noticed a "step-back" from the
                original in-app messaging implementation, as users could previously save music that was sent to them,
                and always be able to see their tracks. Now, with various messaging platforms, users are left with
                locating each song individually, saving them, all while hopping back & forth between apps.
                <br>
                <br>
                Interestingly enough, although the interviewees included iOS users, no one had explicitly mentioned
                using the Messages integration. From here, I decided to narrow my focus on sharing in-app.

        <section>
            <h2>
                Who's Doing Sharing Right?
            </h2>

            <p>
                Now, amidst the above issues, a few users that I interviewed mentioned sharing on Instagram and YouTube
                were great. Although I knew that they took an in-app messaging approach, I used this opportunity to look
                at how they designed their sharing screens.
                <br>
                <br>
                Instagram had a quick method of sharing content to followers by having the button visible on all posts.
                In addition, it is easy to send content to multiple people, unlike Spotify (a frequent problem of mine).
                I found YouTube's sharing screen to be similar, however, I found it cumbersome to have a carousel scroll
                to search through a list of friends/subscribers. One thing it did have, was an easy access to external
                apps, something that I noticed was an extra step in Instagram. As I knew that the main problem was with
                the length of the sharing process, I wondered if I could combine these methods of sharing, to eliminate
                the step of having to click to show external apps.

            <h2>
                What Can I Do About Receiving?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Although sharing seemed quite simple, I wondered how receiving could be done on Spotify knowing that
                messaging at this point was a disproven idea. As my challenge was "... meanwhile making shared items
                more accessible to users...", I looked at the homescreen as to me, this was the most accessible screen
                there was. From here I ideated, how might I allow users to see their shared items from the homescreen?
            </p>

            <h2>
                Sketching Some Ideas
            </h2>
            <p>
                I knew that a bulk of my effort would go towards how songs would be received, so I focused on that
                first.
                I started sketching, and first came up with a queue that would store shared songs. Basically a user
                would have this central queue, accessible from the homescreen, that would pile up with songs whenever
                someone shared music to them. My second idea was a playlist that would
                house songs and lists that would store other content. These lists and playlists would then show up on
                the homescreen as a category, working with the algorithm.
                <br>
                <br>
                I ended up going with this playlist design, as
                I found it to be more robust in handling shared content that was not a single song (i.e: artists,
                playlists, podcasts, etc), a problem that I didn't want to face due to Spotify's integration within
                iMessage.
            </p>

        <img src="img/Spotify-Sketching.webp" class="img-lrg">

        <section>
            <p>
                For the sharing aspect, I went with my previous thoughts of taking inspiration from both Instagram and
                YouTube. I didn't want to change how users used Spotify completely, so I decided to keep sharing where
                it was, but change the resulting screen.

                High-Fidelity Prototypes
            </h2>
            <p>
                Continuing with my second design above, I iterated once more through paper and moved onto Sketch. Both
                the sharing and receiving processes are shown below, contrasted to the current process. The full
                prototype can be accessed <a href="https://invis.io/F9RN2JBC7S3">here</a>.

            <h3>Sharing Screens</h3>
            <p>
                Clicking the share button will allow the user to select from a list of only their Spotify followers (to
                avoid users following others and sending unsolicited items). Users can still easily choose from a list
                of external applications to maintain the length of the existing process.
            </p>

        <section>

            <h3>Receiving Screens</h3>
            <p>
                Aiming at the problem of accessibility and being able to track shared content, items would be found on
                the homescreen. Ideally, with the help of Spotify's algorithm, newly shared content will push the
                categories to the top to be in-view, without scrolling. All shared content can be accessed from the
                Library, similar to other content on Spotify. Items that
                aren't songs/singles, will be shown in lists (shown as an example with playlists).
                <br>
                <br>
                When designing this, I wanted to reduce any additional learning that a user would have to do, and work
                with what Spotify already had.
            </p>
        </section>

            <h2>
                What I Learned from this Side-Project
            </h2>
            <p>
                My main takeaway is to always check if the problem I'm solving for has had failed attempts to avoid
                going down the same path. Clearly, Spotify has made efforts in trying to make a better sharing
                experience for all users; unfortunately, I wasn't one of them.
                <br>
                <br>
                Although my solution may not be perfect, I hope it's a step in the right direction of using existing
                components and functionality to solve the problem. I would assume that it might reduce the costs of
                keeping additional servers running, opposite the case of an inbox feature, and it would make use of the
                algorithm on the homescreen to promote the shared content.
                <br>
                <br>
                Honestly, in the end, I saw the benefit in working with a team as being on my own can really hinder the
                amount of
                ideas I can come up with. Doing this research got my mind into tunnel-vision, and I felt myself
                narrowing on just these 2 ideas of a queue and categories.
