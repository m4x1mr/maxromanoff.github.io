                    Upon joining the team, we had existing research that said millennials weren't purchasing insurance
                    products as much as previous generations. Though this was due to numerous reasons, many felt that
                    they couldn’t trust insurance companies or that they lacked transparency. Through co-creation
                    sessions, the team identified job-loss as a potential winning product, and so when I joined, our
                    challenge was setup to be: how do we position this product to better address our market’s needs?

                    Though we understood peoples’ general feelings towards insurance, I noticed we were missing data
                    around how people felt about after they've lost their job. As we were working quickly, I launched a
                    few unmoderated interviews on UserTesting to get some responses. I focused on asking individuals
                    about the hardest things about
                    the entire experience of losing their job(s), as well as about any advice they would give to someone
                    if they were in the same boat.

                    When collecting and analyzing the data in Excel, I noticed emergent themes surrounding the financial
                    hardship (this was expected), as well as the super-prominent emotional hardship (less expected). I
                    found that the respondents spoke more about support and keeping themselves busy than they did about
                    the actual financials. This was interesting data to consider, especially since we were heading
                    towards a more financially-focused product.

                    One of our primary concerns when creating this product was that it would lead to “anti-selection”,
                    or, only appealing to those that are not eligible for this insurance. As one of our main goals was
                    to address the problem of trust, we wanted to be able to reject certain applicants right away,
                    rather than perpetuating this view by taking their money and rejecting them when it’s time to pay
                    out. We started with questions such as: Company Name, Company Size, Full-Time Employee Status,
                    Knowledge of Being Laid Off, and Income.

                    Though we couldn’t verify this information at the time of sign-up, we ideated that during the time
                    of claim, the user could upload a form that is signed by their employer for verification in order to
                    receive their payout — in this case, we had to also place our trust in the customers.

                    Visual design plays a huge role in a users' first impressions of a platform too, so we took this

                    The lack of trust was something we heard with respect to peoples’ attitudes towards insurance, so we
                    looked at insurance startups to help inform some of our initial design direction. We liked Lemonade
                    as their transparent policy (on Github), their clear exclusions and sign-up process, and its modern
                    design really helped differentiate it from what traditional insurance sites looked like.

                    As we predicted, this ended up causing a lot of questions from our participants. Some of our
                    questions such as “Which province do you live in?”, “What’s your email?” were asked to generate
                    leads, however, participants were questioning why this was needed as some of the information could
                    be gathered from the ROE.

                    <br>
                    A result of this problem, was that we began to add small descriptions under the heading/question to
                    explain why we were asking each question.

                    We initially offered 3 tiers of plans by income group, as our research showed that layoffs were

                    disliked this. We found that they felt excluded and that it wasn’t personalized, and wanted the
                    option for the higher income plan even if they could not afford it.

                    when coupled with EI. I designed it with our colours to be the darker purple. From our testing, we
                    found that users liked the idea of the visuals, but did not understand it (poor execution on my
                    part). I found that some missed the detail about the amount of weeks that they would be covered for,
                    so that had to be made more salient. This was an important detail as this was the primary
                    differentiator between each tiered plan.

                    <br>

                    bit by focusing on the content, but at the same time, that was our primary objective to focus on. As
                    we had a very simple site, with a linear sign-up, we had a lot more wiggle room to focus on how we
                    worded every specific detail and a lot more time to think about the product strategy.

                    (mostly high-risk users were signing up) was still very prevalent. In addition, despite our efforts
                    at transparency, we found the opposite reaction with our participants as they hated seeing the
                    amount of exclusions. We knew we couldn't have a perfect product, therefore there'd have to be some
                    sort of middle-ground.

                    some have attributed that to the RBC branding in the footer. All participants found the process
                    simple and easy to follow. And most participants liked the design, whitespace and illustrations, and

                    working on something different. One day I could be doing only UI, and the next, I could be working
                    on strategy and help identify issues that could seriously affect the final product. It definitely
                    wasn't dull, and gets me excited to work in something mixed in strategy and design.
