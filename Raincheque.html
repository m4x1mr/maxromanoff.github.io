            <p>
                <br>
                <br>
                Genoa Labs is an innovation team within RBC Insurance tasked in researching the mass underserved market
                (the low-middle income customer segment that is seemingly uninterested in purchasing traditional
                insurance). Prior to me joining the team, a lot of research was done to discover that millennials
                weren't purchasing insurance products as much as previous generations. Co-creation sessions were held,
                which led to the team identifying job-loss as a potential winning product. When I joined, our challenge
                was then set up to be: how do we position this product to better address our market’s needs?
                <br>
                <br>
                Throughout my 4-months on the team, my role was to ideate and design the first prototypes for the
                website. I also worked closely with the product manager on the product & MVP strategy, content design
                and the visuals. In the end, I also made a montage to advertise our team internally within RBC!

            <h3>
                The Process
            </h3>
            <h2>
                Surveying Market Segments
            </h2>
            <p>
                When I joined the team, our team wanted to gain better insight into what peoples’ thoughts were around
                job-loss; therefore, to get quick responses, I launched surveys on UserTesting to understand their
                feelings. I’m lucky to have never lost a job before, so I had to ask individuals about things like the
                hardest things about the entire experience of losing their job(s) as well as about any advice they would
                give to someone if they were in the same boat.
                <br>
                <br>
            </p>
            <h3>
                “The hardest part [of losing a job] was dealing with the stress, financials and pride.“
                <br>
                <br>
                “Try to save as much money as you can and apply to everything and anything you can find. Take care of
                yourself and remember you aren’t alone…”
            </h3>
            <p>
                <br>
                <br>
                When collecting and analyzing the data in Excel, I
                noticed emergent themes surrounding the financial hardship (this was expected), as well as the
                super-prominent emotional hardship (less expected). I found that the respondents spoke more about
                support and keeping themselves busy than they did about the actual financials. This was interesting data
                to consider, especially since we were heading towards a more financially-focused product.

            <h2>
                Journey Mapping
            </h2>
            <p>
                Through understanding our segments' feelings, our team had a better idea of how to create a
                comprehensive initial journey map. First impressions are everything, so we wanted to look at the
                ideal-state purchase journey. We now knew that users could be in a fragile state when discussing
                job-loss (in addition to their financial motivations), therefore we saw the eligibility criteria (in
                stage 4) as a solid area of opportunity for extra clear content.
                <br>
                <br>
                I found in my research that users could
                feel "hopeless" and irritated, therefore we wanted to make sure exclusions were clearly explained with
                reasoning behind them. Though we had our vision of long into the future, this journey map was created to
                help us visualize our MVP launch.

            <h2>
                Competitive Analysis
            </h2>
            <p>
                Parallel to the consumer research, I looked into the existing state of job-loss, with things such as
                eligibility requirements for employment insurance, insight into records of employment (ROEs), and
                provincial laws behind severance pays. This research fed into our content strategy, exclusion criteria
                and our strategy for a second MVP that could be launched. I learned that ROEs can provide confirmation
                about an individual's employment type at a company, as well as find out how or why they were laid off.
                <br>
                <br>
                In addition to that research, we looked at existing companies such as Lemonade to help inform some of
                our design's direction. Although it wasn't the only insurance company we looked at, we liked some
                primary features such as its transparent policy (put on Github), how clear their exclusions and sign-up
                process were, and its modern design (different from traditional insurance).

            <h2>
                Early Sketching
            </h2>

            <div class="spacer-block-xs"></div>

            <p>
                Getting into the design, the Product Manager and I worked on the question flow that would be used to
                determine someone's eligibility; some of these questions would address our fears of anti-selection (i.e:
                only appealing only to those we were intending on excluding).
                <br>
                <br>
                We initially asked questions such as: Company Name, Company Size, Full-Time Employee Status, Knowledge
                of Being Laid Off, Income, etc, but soon realized that a lot of these answers could be obtained on an
                ROE during claims. Our primary goal was to address the problem of trust and try to reject certain
                applicants right away, rather than take their money and reject them later during time of claims. The
                problem we faced was that some of these questions were not available on an ROE, therefore we wouldn't be
                able to verify them (either initially or during time of claim). For the time being, we ideated a form
                that could potentially be downloaded and given to an employer for verification.

            <h2>
                Design Concepts & Testing
            </h2>
            <p>
                After the sketching phase, I created prototypes in Sketch and iterated multiple times following feedback
                on UserTesting. We heard feedback on all parts of the design, from the content, to the product itself,
                to the way we designed certain elements on the page.
            </p>
            <h3>— Ambiguous Questions</h3>
            <p>
                As we predicted, this ended up causing a lot of questions from our participants. Some of our questions
                such as “Which province do you live in?”, “What’s your email?” were asked to generate leads, however,
                participants were questioning why this was needed as some of the information could be gathered from the
                ROE.
                <br>
                <br>
                A result of this problem, was that we began to add small descriptions under the heading/question to
                explain why we were asking each question.

            </p>
            <img src="img/Raincheque-AmbiguousQ.png" alt="">
            <h3>— Plans by Income Group</h3>
            <p>
                We initially offered 3 tiers of plans by income group, as our research showed that layoffs were
                correlated to income groups. However, despite offering a catered option, lower income users really
                disliked this. We found that they felt excluded and that it wasn’t personalized, and wanted the option
                for the higher income plan even if they could not afford it.
                <br>
                <br>
                For the final design, we opted for a calculator that would provide a more personalized option for each
                type of income. Each income, however, would receive their own 3 tiers of options, if they did in fact
                want to go for the most expensive coverage option.
            </p>
            <img src="img/Raincheque-Plans.png" alt="">
            <h3>— Donut Charts</h3>
            <p>
                The Product Manager ideated Donut Charts as a way to help emulate how much our top-up could help, when
                coupled with EI. I designed it with our colours to be the darker purple. From our testing, we found that
                users liked the idea of the visuals, but did not understand it (poor execution on my part). I found that
                some missed the detail about the amount of weeks that they would be covered for, so that had to be made
                more salient. This was an important detail as this was the primary differentiator between each tiered
                plan.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the end, we decided to completely scrap this visual and stick to the basics. We chose to do a slider
                that would show each plan change dynamically per income chosen.

            <h2>
                Final Designs
            </h2>
            <p>
                Following a few testing sessions through UserTesting, I worked on refining some of the above issues into
                a more comprehensive prototype. I found that the Product Manager and I were being held back a bit by
                focusing on the content, but at the same time, that was our primary objective to focus on. As we had a
                very simple site, with a linear sign-up, we had a lot more wiggle room to focus on how we worded every
                specific detail and a lot more time to think about the product strategy.

                Results from this Prototype
            </h2>
            <h3>
                **With specific quant data removed**
            </h3>

            <p>
                After over 5 launches on UserTesting.com (and a crazy amount of iterations), we ended up realizing that
                it's still an insurance product (surprise!).
                <br>
                <br>
                We found that despite our efforts, the problem of anti-selection with early adopters & participants
                (mostly high-risk users were signing up) was still very prevalent. In addition, despite our efforts at
                transparency, we found the opposite reaction with our participants as they hated seeing the amount of
                exclusions. We knew we couldn't have a perfect product, therefore there'd have to be some sort of
                middle-ground.
                <br>
                <br>
                On a positive note, we found that almost all participants found the design and idea trustworthy; some
                have attributed that to the RBC branding in the footer. All participants found the process simple and
                easy to follow. And most participants liked the design, whitespace and illustrations, and found it
                refreshing compared to what they're usually used to seeing.

            <h2>
                What I Learned from this Internship
            </h2>

            <div class="spacer-block-xs"></div>

            <p>
                I was exposed to consumer research, design research, UI design, marketing, business, and video editing
                all while working in a startup environment for 4 months. This was the first time I've been exposed to
                Lean Startup within the workplace and working so quickly and iteratively. It was also exciting working
                with so many people higher up in the organization and seeing how many different teams this type of
                project brings together.
                <br>
                <br>
                Before working on this team, this is something I would’ve never expected from a large company. Being
                able to basically “wing-it” when it came to our methods of problem solving compared to having a systemic
                way of going about a process is refreshing. I also loved the fact that everyday was spent working on
                something different. One day I could be doing only UI, and the next, I could be working on strategy and
                help identify issues that could seriously affect the final product. It definitely wasn't dull, and gets
                me excited to work in something mixed in strategy and design.
                <br>
