                <p>One of the biggest challenges facing grocery e-commerce is substitutions. When customers had
                    substitutions through PC Express, store employees would call the customer prior to pickup to review
                    them.

                <p>I led the design for the customer experience allowing customers to approve and reject substitutions
                    asynchronously through PC Express. This solution is expected to save over 81,000 labour hours and
                    over $2.8M in labour costs.

                    specifically for the customer experience, I worked closely with the designer on the fulfillment side
                    (Jess)
                    and the operations teams which dealt with the store employee experiences. Operations teams were
                    crucial in the success of this project because they defined how information flows to store employees
                    and the timing of the notification to customers.

                    <p class="heading">Substitutions are crucial for the customer and for our business.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Today, PC Express primarily operates its grocery delivery and pickup services through its stores.
                    That means that if you place an order online, there’s a store employee picking the order. What that
                    also means is your groceries can’t be fully guaranteed because someone who’s shopping in-store
                    could’ve taken the last item. Though this affects customers, this also affects store operations
                    because that means the order isn’t 100% filled (a major KPI), which results in losses for the
                    business. Substitutions become important because they provide a customer an opportunity to still get
                    a similar item and provide the business an opportunity to get closer to the 100% fill-rate.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    Things start to fall apart when customers get inaccurate substitutions or when those substitutions
                    are substantially more expensive. What we do to mitigate those situations is to call the customer
                    shortly before they receive their order to ask if they’re okay with those changes to the order. </p>
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    What we learned in this project is that customers really like the phone call due to it’s personal
                    touch, yet operations teams dislike it due to its impact to productivity at the stores.</p>

                <p>One of our key business goals was to increase OSAT (Order Satisfaction) scores and address customer
                    churn. Recent research showed us that expensive substitutions and inaccurate substitutions were some
                    of the biggest reasons for churn from our businesses. We knew addressing this problem in some
                    capacity can start to regain trust with our customers and impact our business positively.

                </div>

                <p>Substitutions spanned across the customer and store employee experiences, so I defined a workshop to
                    align everyone on what the key problems are. The goal of the session was to inform everyone on the
                    customer impacts, and have teams ideate and vote on what they believe to be the key issues.
                </p>

                        efficiency.</p>
                </div>

                <p>Once the problems were aligned on, we defined the most important measures of success before defining
                    the solutions. I designed for this step to happen before ideation because I wanted teams to think
                    objectively during voting.
                </p><br>
                <p>Once we ideated on solutions and voted on them based on our KPIs, we had two solutions that we needed
                    to decide on: "Async Sub Management" and "Search for Subs". The latter was a solution to allow for
                    customers to search for the substitutions they want. Currently, the platform only offers a
                    recommended items, which aren't always accurate.</p>

                <p>I presented the outcomes of the workshop to senior leadership teams, and decided to continue with the
                    solution that impacted both customers and store employees. The solution was two-fold: to allow
                    customers to approve and reject substitutions asynchronously, and to remove reliance on the
                    phone-call for reviewing substitutions (a major impact to store employees).

                <p>I worked with Jess to define the service map and understand when this

                    “staged” meaning everything for the order has been picked, typically an hour before the order is

                <br>
                <p>When a customer reviews their order on the app or website today, they would see a read-only view of
                    their substitutions and any items that were not available and didn’t have a substitution selected.

                </div>
                <p>I explored variations of how the approval and rejection could look for substitutions. I reused a set
                    of buttons that acted akin to toggles elsewhere in the experience to ensure consistency. I used a
                    sheet interaction for app because the customer can’t return or make edits to their submission and
                    since it’s time sensitive, it’s meant to be quick.
                </p><br>
                <p>In addition, I worked with Operations to also show items that were expiring within a few days, since
                    it’s discussed during the phone call — in general, these “order updates” were now referred to as
                    “exceptions”. Something else we added during the design phase was the option to opt-in for a phone
                    call from the store employees. Though this was the exact function that this project was meant to
                    replace, we wanted to learn if customers still wanted the call outside of this feature. </p>

                    to build upon what we already had in the experience. The changes were to add actions to the existing

                    development teams also liked this approach as the foundation for this UI already existed.

                    <p class="heading">Feedback was positive, but customers weren't confident that their selections were
                        saved.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Overall, customers were able to locate the experience and make the appropriate selections to their
                    exceptions and found it really easy! The main point of feedback was the submission, some customers
                    felt stuck and weren’t sure if their selections were saved or not. This made a lot of sense in
                    hindsight, so we knew we had to add that back in.
                </p><br>
                <p>The other piece of feedback was about the phone call. Customers had questions about when it would
                    happen and what decisions they would be able to make on it. This revelation led the ops team to
                    reconsider the decision to include it.

                </div>
                <p>Jess and I designed a brief workshop to align the teams on what the scope was for MVP and what
                    wasn’t. We found the teams were spinning on the timing of when this notification for the ability to
                    manage exceptions was sent to customers, as well as the phone call. We had the teams write down
                    pro’s and con’s for the different ideas and vote to include it into MVP or not. </p><br>
                <p>The outcome was a resounding ‘yes’ to continue with the inclusion of the phone call toggle because
                    the benefits far outweighed the cons. Since we couldn’t guarantee whether a customer actually
                    received a call or not, we also knew we had an option to simply learn from the toggle, but not send
                    any response to store employees to avoid impacting their workflows. </p>

                    were almost identical. I started to share these with our web and app teams and fielded questions
                    about how we would get data from the store employees and different edge cases such as errors and
                    timeout states. </p>

                <p>Despite the workshop from Jess and I to finalize scope for MVP, the over a year-long pause gave time
                    for Ops to rethink decisions and make changes to the experience. The phone call was ultimately
                    removed. We have a new paragraph block for a payment issue that could happen for some customers. We
                    have a separate section for preselected substitutions (if a customer has made substitution
                    selections in cart).

                <p>I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t proud of my efforts on this project. I was able to lead the design
                    end-to-end, in addition to defining project milestones and estimating my work accurately. I liked
                    the challenge and the ability to design something that will inevitably make a big difference to both
                    store employees and customers. The stuff I didn’t like was out of my control. Business priorities
                    shifted and thus this project got deprioritized, and it’s still something I question today
                    considering substitutions is our #1 problem to solve.
                </p><br>
                <p>What I would’ve done differently is to have the workshop to align on MVP scope earlier, but that’s
                    nitpicking… If this project had launched, I would’ve loved to add more details about the impacts and
                    how the learnings from customers and employees then impacted the experience moving forward.
