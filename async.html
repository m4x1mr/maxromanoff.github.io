                    "Async Subs" enabled customers to review grocery substitutions asynchronously instead of by phone,
                    improving customer satisfaction and saving 60,000 hours and $3M+ in labour costs in just 2 months.

            <section class="content-block copy">
                <h2 class="heading">Context</h2>
                <p>
                    Substitutions are crucial for both customers and the business. When an item is unavailable, offering
                    a comparable alternative allows customers to complete their order while helping the business
                    preserve revenue. As a result, order fill-rate is a core KPI, with the target being as close to 100%
                    as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, substitutions are also a major source of frustration. “Too many substitutions” is a leading
                    driver of churn on PC Express, accounting for roughly 20% of lost customers. Expensive or inaccurate
                    replacements further erode trust and satisfaction.
                </p>

            <section class="content-block copy">
                <h2 class="heading">Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    To mitigate these issues, stores rely on a manual process. Customers receive a read-only email
                    showing substitutions and out-of-stock items, followed by a phone call shortly before pickup to
                    approve or reject changes. Customers value the personal touch of the call, but from an operational
                    standpoint it is inefficient, time-consuming, and difficult to scale across hundreds of stores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The existing digital experience offers visibility, but no control. Customers are dependent on the
                    phone call to make changes, and store employees spend several minutes per order coordinating
                    substitutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Operations proposed removing phone calls altogether and enabling customers to manage substitutions
                    online, framing it as an opportunity to save millions in labour costs annually. Before committing to
                    that direction, we needed to align cross-functional teams on what the right problem to solve
                    actually was—balancing customer trust, operational efficiency, and business impact—before defining a
                    solution.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section class="content-block copy">
                <h2 class="heading">Approach</h2>
                <p>
                    I led the design of an asynchronous substitution management experience that allowed customers to
                    review, approve, or reject substitutions digitally within a time-sensitive window.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I started with designing and facilitating workshops to align teams on the real problem and define
                    success metrics before jumping into solutions—Async Subs was aligned as the one with the highest
                    impact. From there, I started to iterate through designs, mainly building on the existing
                    experience. I tested an autosave option, but found from customers that they preferred to explicitly
                    save their selections.

            <!-- CHALLENGES -->
            <section class="content-block copy">
                <h2 class="heading">Challenges</h2>
                <p>
                    Though operational efficiency was a key goal, we didn't want to skimp on the customer experience.
                    Research told us customers loved the call, due to its personal touch and immediacy, so my PM and I
                    wanted to test if this async experience could truly deliver the same level of trust and
                    satisfaction. The idea was to have a toggle allowing customers to opt into a phone call if they
                    preferred.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though the Ops team agreed, our leadership team said that since our goal was to get rid of the call
                    entirely, it didn't make sense to offer it as an option. Ultimately, we had to prioritize
                    operational goals
                    over customer preferences in this case, which was a tough but necessary trade-off.

                <p>
                    The solution had incredible results. Within 2 months, customer adoption reached over 60%, with
                    measurable reductions in store labour. In the same period, the program contributed to
                    60,000 hours saved and over $3M in projected annual cost savings.

                    While broader customer metrics like retention were planned for longer-term evaluation, early signals
                    showed improved clarity and confidence in managing substitutions.

                <p>
                    Balancing business needs with customer wants was a constant theme throughout this project. The
                    Operations team was initially hesitant about the workshops, as they felt confident in their proposed
                    solution, but ultimately found value in the process as the outcomes helped inform the roadmap. One
                    of the biggest challenges we faced came from consistently shifting business priorities, where
                    decisions were occasionally retracted and led to redesigns—most notably around the phone call
                    toggle.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite the contextual complexity of the problem, the solution itself remained intentionally simple.
                    I felt like I was learning something new from the Operations team every week, and I enjoyed owning
                    this project end to end—from discovery and solution definition through detailed design and launch.
                    It was a rewarding challenge and an opportunity to design something that made a meaningful impact
                    for both store employees and customers.
