            <p>
                <br>
                <br>
                This <a
                    href="https://ruhacks2019.hackerearth.com/challenges/hackathon/ru-hacks-2019/dashboard/f0739c8/submission/">project</a>
                was part of a 36-hour hackathon hosted by Ryerson University (RU Hacks).
                Working in a team of 3 — me being the Product Manager and my friends being the developers — we ended
                up winning a $1000 prize through a side-challenge sponsored by iTradeNetwork!
                <br>
                <br>
                The theme for the overall hackathon was Around the World, or creating a project involving Communications
                and Global Data Exchange and any technology that can help with issues that plague societies. We found
                this to be very generic, so we looked for a bit more guidance at some of the side-challenges. As a
                result, the team and I opted for iTradeNetwork’s challenge of making something cool to improve or
                innovate the food and beverage industry as we felt that there was lots of opportunity to try and solve
                for.
                <br>
                <br>
                Right away, we wanted to explore food-wastage, and take a look at that at a global scale. Although we
                knew we wouldn't be able to just get rid of this problem completely, we tried to find a niche in which
                we could comfortably take a seat in. That niche was dealing with leftover ingredients after a bad-case
                of overbuying.

            <h3>
                The Process
            </h3>
            <h2>
                The Problem with Food Waste
            </h2>
            <p>
                Getting even more niche, we started to focus on the Canadian market. With my research, I discovered that
                Canadians, specifically, throw out about <a
                    href="https://lovefoodhatewaste.ca/about/food-waste/">63%</a> of their edible food, amounting to
                about 2.2M tonnes
                annually (or about 140kg per household). This to me was ridiculous, because even if this was reduced to
                just 50%, each household could reduce their food waste by almost 30kg. Addressing food-wastage at this
                scale could have serious impacts on the environment, so we tried to understand why.

        <section>
            <h2>
                Why Was This Happening?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Although proper planning, storage and preparation are obvious answers, a less obvious one is the lack of
                <a href="https://www.epa.gov/recycle/reducing-wasted-food-home#thriftiness">“thriftiness”</a> in the
                kitchen. One thing that the USA's Environmental Protection Agency recommends is
                planning a leftovers night to ensure that nothing in the fridge ends up needlessly in the trash, as well
                as better education about labels such as "best-before" vs. "expiry".
                <br>
                <br>
                Despite this, many people may still not know how to prepare an edible meal with the seemingly random
                ingredients leftover in their fridge. Our challenge was to figure out, how might we help users figure
                out what to cook with their leftover ingredients (in a cool and innovative way)?
            </p>
        </section>



        <section>
            <h2>
                Who Is This Affecting?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Being on a time-constraint, and being millennials ourselves, I decided to primarily focus on this user
                group.
                <br>
                <br>
                With my research, I found that <a
                    href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/consumer-insights/cooking-trends-among-millennials/">59%</a>
                of millennials take advantage of their phones when cooking in the
                kitchen; yet despite this, 31% of these millennials still believe that choosing what to cook is the
                least enjoyable part. Comparing this with our own experiences, we too found bottlenecks in using
                technology due to the shear amount of choices involved (resonating with the latter statistic), however,
                cookbooks would almost always be our last choice to look at.
                <br>
                <br>
                As a result we developed this Jonathan persona, to represent someone that dislikes traditional methods
                of searching for recipes, yet despite their access to technology, often feels overwhelmed by the amount
                of options there are online. This is someone who would find themselves stuck on what to cook, yet have a
                fridge full of seemingly unrelated ingredients.

            <h3>
                The Actual Hackathon
            </h3>
            <h2>
                The First 24 Hours
            </h2>

            <p>
                With our problem of thriftiness in the kitchen, our persona who loves using his phone in the kitchen,
                and our challenge of making something "cool" we ideated an SMS chatbot which would help by sending
                recipes based on leftover ingredients sent by the users. Before moving any further with this idea, we
                wanted to work backwards and see if this was doable; we came up with using Twilio to help us send the
                texts, and then use Spoonacular API to help us gather the recipes.
                <br>
                <br>
                I understood from our research that planning is a huge aspect to mitigate food waste, therefore our main
                value proposition focused on that by allowing users to search for recipes by combinations of
                ingredients, rather than the other way around. Cookbooks require users to search by recipe(s) and find
                ingredients after-the-fact; this lacks convenience and isn’t always accessible. Google fares better with
                widespread accessibility, however it can overwhelm users with the vast amount of choices, faring worse
                for our target users.

            <p>
                I worked on the main process flows for our system (being the initial sign-up and the actual interaction
                for receiving a recipe) to help the developers anticipate the data to be sent back and forth between the
                user and the system. A sign-up flow would be important in confirming the users' sign-up, and the recipe
                request flow was important to determine edge-cases where the system could break by certain inputs by the
                user.
                <br>
                <br>
                The rest of the night ended up being slow as I then spent the night testing bugs with the developers.

            <p>
                During the last 12-hour set, I slowly started working on our pitch deck before moving onto the
                design and branding of our site.
                <br>
                <br>
                We went with name of RecipeFlow and a logo of a "fast plate" to get our point across that that's what
                we're in business for. I ideated that our site would be a single page with a single text-field to enter
                your phone number, anything extra would be unnecessary.

                After 36-hours, we pitched our product to a bunch of judges and other students. As mentioned, we
                delivered a website and a chatbot through SMS that sends 3 recipes based on ingredients sent in by the
                user. <a href="https://recipeflow.netlify.app/">Click here</a> to view the website and sign up!

            <h2>
                Different From Other Projects
            </h2>
            <p>
                Although it was my first hackathon, I'm really proud of myself and my team that we created something so
                innovative and cool within 36-hours and that our efforts were recognized with a category win. The
                teamwork aspect of projects like this are unmatched and the adrenaline of having something launched this
                quickly is definitely a plus. In addition, making my first pitch deck and learning more about
                conversational design was also a great outcome of this.
                <br>
                <br>
                Looking back as I'm writing this (May 2020), I'm definitely considering revisiting this project and
                pushing it forward more. I feel that something like this could have been a great addition to many
                quarantined families looking to get active in the kitchen, or even just curious teens looking to make
                something quick from something in their fridges.
