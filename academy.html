                </div>
                <p>Academy (for short) is one of the largest sporting goods retailers in the US; they currently operate
                    over 280 stores from the midwest to the south and southeast states. Their product assortment covers
                    everything someone might need for hunting, fishing, barbecuing, or sports. When we engaged with our
                    clients at Academy, they just finished off 2020 with revenue exceeding $5.6B.

                </div>

                <p>Since the COVID pandemic, e-commerce sales spiked and the need for sports and outdoors goods spiked
                    as well, putting Academy in a fantastic position. The issue was, all of this traffic was going to
                    their website. We helped Academy ideate ways to increase their engagement with this new influx of
                    customers, and one of the outcomes was an app. The goals of releasing an app would be a new revenue
                    stream and an opportunity to engage with customers using push-notifications to drive more sales.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    For the initial MVP of the app, we aimed to have parity with the mobile web experience.

                </div>

                <p>We planned to use this information in our design process by understanding their core needs and how
                    each type of customer would benefit from a new feature. Though each segment had their own core
                    focus, we still found that all segments would benefit from: convenience and details about
                    fulfillment options, easy to
                    access details about products and testimonials, and clear pricing and details on sales.

                    Once we knew the business need and who we were building this for, we were clear on the opportunity.

                </div>

                <p>I took on the work for the PDP, while my team tackled other areas of the experience. Through
                    resources such as Baymard and Nielsen Norman Group (NNG), I learned that customers are used to
                    scrolling and swiping up, so I should avoid hiding information behind a drop
                    down. The concept of “above the fold” doesn’t exist for app, and so content should be laid out that
                    reduces friction from the main action, scrolling.
                </p><br>
                <p>I also noticed that the biggest retailer in the world, Amazon, does this really well, and typically
                    exposes all the information for customers to scroll through.</p>

                    <p class="heading">Target's PDP did a great job of exposing content</p>
                </div>
                <p>We also worked with our clients to understand who they feel are their competitors in the space.
                    Though Dick’s Sporting Goods was their biggest direct competitor (and still is), their app was a
                    webview of their website experience. At the same time, Target’s iOS app was consistently used as a
                    reference for a best-in-class experience. </p>
                <br>
                <p>For the PDP, I took note of Target’s approach to expose all options and information and their
                    extensive related products carousels towards the bottom of the page. I liked that Target never made
                    the PDP for an item a dead-end, and hyperfocused on (what I assume to be) either their primary
                    customer base, or the primary customer action they want to encourage, in-store pickup. The biggest
                    negative of the PDP experience was that the reviews section was at the very bottom of the page, and
                    hidden.

                </div>
                <p>Academy supports five different product types on their website, all of which had different PDP
                    layouts and needed their own designs: “Regular” products, gift cards, e-gift cards, bundles, and
                    firearms and ammunition. I started with the regular PDP as this covered most
                    products sold through Academy.
                </p><br>
                <p>Though Academy was already doing a great job servicing their customer segments, I took it a step
                    further and exposed product details and the reviews to let Passion Pursuers, as well as the other
                    segments, review everything easily.</p>

                </div>
                <p>After hearing that firearms were being sold on Academy’s site, I had an assumption that this wouldn’t
                    be allowed through a mobile app, considering Apple’s strict guidelines. I found this was true after
                    doing some digging in the App Store's guidelines.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    I took this to our client and shared out scenarios where I thought we could still sell firearms, and
                    ideally make an easier purchasing experience for our 3 segments.
                    Some examples being: allowing customers to add firearms to cart, but continue
                    the purchase on web; Letting customers add firearms to a wishlist. Adding messaging saying sales are
                    prohibited by Apple. I took these examples and called Apple support, however, every idea was shut
                    down. In addition to the scenarios I outlined, we
                    also
                    weren’t allowed to advertise firearms to customers.

                </div>
                <p>I raised the findings to the Design and Product teams as a risk to our strategy. Working with the
                    Product team, we ideated and defined generic messaging to say firearms can't be sold in the app, and
                    to re-route these customers to the web experience.
                </p><br>
                <p>Going back to our customer segments, specifically the Convenience Chaser, I proposed to include store
                    availability on the PDP to let them see these details before sending them to the web experience.</p>

                <p>
                    Deeper into the project, we learned that the design team at Academy was redesigning the web
                    experience.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The issue was, they also expected the app designs to comply. We had to go back to the drawing board.

                </div>
                <p>The change to the PDP was to use one sticky Add to Cart button, with another Apple Pay button beside
                    it (PayPal on Web), and to use
                    a radio button that defaults to Free Store Pick Up for fulfillment. I raised a hypothesis to Academy
                    that
                    this would impact customers, as they wouldn’t be able to see what fulfillment option was selected
                    before they chose to Add to Cart. The biggest risk with that was
                    if they chose to use Apple Pay and place the order right away. </p>

                </div>
                <p> When asked specifically about this interaction during testing, most participants called it out as
                    awkward. I tried to redesign this interaction and present these options back to Academy for
                    consideration.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    For my first proposal, I placed the add to cart button below the fulfillment options, so customers
                    would be forced to scroll past them. Since we know our customer segments scroll and want more
                    information, this would make a lot of sense. </p><br>

                <p>The second proposal kept the buttons as sticky, but
                    placed a callout in the add to cart for what fulfillment option was selected. We know Convenience
                    Chasers want convenience, so letting them know what fulfillment option was selected would
                    also make a lot of sense. Unfortunately, both proposals were rejected, so we proceeded with web
                    parity on the far right.</p>

                </div>
                <p>In addition to the radio buttons, I worked with our client to define every possible state that could
                    appear, and then I designed out the component and it’s variants. This would help our development
                    partners to ensure we’ve designed a scalable solution and accounted for all edge-cases.

                <p>Throughout the process I facilitated design reviews with the client, and we reviewed designs again
                    once the PDP was finalized to get their sign off. I continued with designing the rest of the PDPs,
                    the rest of which followed closer to parity and faced less push-back. This entire process, from
                    research to working with devs, only took 2 weeks!

                <p>Though the PDP is what I focused on for this case study, I continued to work through other aspects of

                    for the launch.

                    <p class="heading">We faced a few hiccups along the way</p>
                </div>
                <p>We had a lot of challenges throughout the engagement, no engagement is perfect.The tight timeline was
                    probably the biggest challenge. 12 weeks is what we had to design the entire
                    app from scratch. This cascaded to miscommunications, and it didn’t help that we had to go through
                    rework since the client was redesigning their web experience.
                </p><br>
                <p>Collaboration with the dev team was a challenge because of timezone differences. As the dev team was
                    located in India, design decisions were communicated asynchronously, and often led to
                    miscommunications.
                </p><br>
                <p>Lastly, at the time, I had an Android phone, in Canada. I lacked access to many of the competitor iOS
                    apps (Dick’s, Target) as they aren’t available in my device (though I was able to sideload the APK
                    files). I also wasn’t able to test the QA test the Academy iOS app.

                </div>
                <p>Baymard was a lifesaver in this project. It was helpful to quickly search for specific interactions,
                    rather than always referring to a set of competitors to see what they did. But, looking back,
                    there’s definitely ways I could’ve handled myself better and been more proactive. Using Figma
                    would’ve saved our team a lot of headaches. We used Adobe XD because our client’s design
                    files were in XD, but we didn’t need to use it. Component issues, connectivity, and collaboration
                    were all things that affected the way we worked.
                </p><br>
                <p>I would have proactively held meetings with the Designer at Academy to better understand what they
                    were designing, to avoid re-work. We started doing this a bit after the PDP debacle, but I still
                    don’t think it was enough because I faced challenges when designing checkout.
                </p><br>
                <p>And lastly, I would’ve said “Yes” to my team offering to help with my workload. They were fantastic
                    and super supportive, but I think I tried to take on too much at once and began to get burnt out.
