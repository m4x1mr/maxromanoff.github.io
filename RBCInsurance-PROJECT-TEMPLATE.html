                COVID-19 pandemic that started just a few months later.

                    Upon joining the team, we had existing research that said millennials weren't purchasing insurance
                    products as much as previous generations. Though this was due to numerous reasons, many felt that
                    they couldn’t trust insurance companies or that they lacked transparency. Through co-creation
                    sessions, the team identified job-loss as a potential winning product, and so when I joined, our
                    challenge was setup to be: how do we position this product to better address our market’s needs?

                    Though we understood peoples’ general feelings around insurance, I wanted to start with
                    understanding peoples’ thoughts around job-loss specifically; I launched a few surveys on
                    UserTesting to get quick responses. I focused on asking individuals about the hardest things about
                    the entire experience of losing their job(s), as well as about any advice they would give to someone
                    if they were in the same boat.

                    <br>
                    When collecting and analyzing the data in Excel, I noticed emergent themes surrounding the financial
                    hardship (this was expected), as well as the super-prominent emotional hardship (less expected). I
                    found that the respondents spoke more about support and keeping themselves busy than they did about
                    the actual financials. This was interesting data to consider, especially since we were heading
                    towards a more financially-focused product.

                <p>
                    As the lack of trust was something we wanted to address, we looked at insurance startups such as
                    Lemonade to help inform some of our initial design direction. Although it wasn't the only insurance
                    company we looked at, we liked some primary features such as its transparent policy (put on Github),
                    how clear their exclusions and sign-up process were, and its modern design (different from
                    traditional insurance).

                    One of our primary concerns when creating this product was that it would lead to “anti-selection”,
                    or, only appealing to those that are not eligible for this insurance. As one of our main goals was
                    to address the problem of trust, we wanted to be able to reject certain applicants right away,
                    rather than perpetuating this view by taking their money and rejecting them when it’s time to pay
                    out. We started with questions such as: Company Name, Company Size, Full-Time Employee Status,
                    Knowledge of Being Laid Off, and Income.

                    Though we couldn’t verify this information at the time of sign-up, we ideated that during the time
                    of claim, the user could upload a form that is signed by their employer for verification in order to
                    receive their payout — in this case, we had to also place our trust in the customers.

                    As we predicted, this ended up causing a lot of questions from our participants. Some of our
                    questions such as “Which province do you live in?”, “What’s your email?” were asked to generate
                    leads, however, participants were questioning why this was needed as some of the information could
                    be gathered from the ROE.

                    <br>
                    A result of this problem, was that we began to add small descriptions under the heading/question to
                    explain why we were asking each question.

                    We initially offered 3 tiers of plans by income group, as our research showed that layoffs were
                    correlated to income groups. However, despite offering a catered option, lower income users really
                    disliked this. We found that they felt excluded and that it wasn’t personalized, and wanted the
                    option for the higher income plan even if they could not afford it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    For the final design, we opted for a calculator that would provide a more personalized option for
                    each type of income. Each income, however, would receive their own 3 tiers of options, if they did
                    in fact want to go for the most expensive coverage option.

                <p>
                    The Product Manager ideated Donut Charts as a way to help emulate how much our top-up could help,
                    when coupled with EI. I designed it with our colours to be the darker purple. From our testing, we
                    found that users liked the idea of the visuals, but did not understand it (poor execution on my
                    part). I found that some missed the detail about the amount of weeks that they would be covered for,
                    so that had to be made more salient. This was an important detail as this was the primary
                    differentiator between each tiered plan.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In the end, we decided to completely scrap this visual and stick to the basics. We chose to do a
                    slider that would show each plan change dynamically per income chosen.

                    Following a few testing sessions through UserTesting, I worked on refining some of the above issues
                    into a more comprehensive prototype. I found that the Product Manager and I were being held back a
                    bit by focusing on the content, but at the same time, that was our primary objective to focus on. As
                    we had a very simple site, with a linear sign-up, we had a lot more wiggle room to focus on how we
                    worded every specific detail and a lot more time to think about the product strategy.

                    I was exposed to consumer research, design research, UI design, marketing, business, and video
                    editing all while working in a startup environment for 4 months. This was the first time I've been
                    exposed to Lean Startup within the workplace and working so quickly and iteratively. It was also
                    exciting working with so many people higher up in the organization and seeing how many different
                    teams this type of project brings together.

                    Before working on this team, this is something I would’ve never expected from a large company. Being
                    able to basically “wing-it” when it came to our methods of problem solving compared to having a
                    systemic way of going about a process is refreshing. I also loved the fact that everyday was spent
                    working on something different. One day I could be doing only UI, and the next, I could be working
                    on strategy and help identify issues that could seriously affect the final product. It definitely
                    wasn't dull, and gets me excited to work in something mixed in strategy and design.
