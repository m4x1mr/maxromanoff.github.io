                <p class="heading">TL;DR</p>
                <p>PC Express is Loblaws’ answer to a customer need for receiving groceries by ordering online. By
                    servicing the largest grocery chain in Canada — Loblaws and its subsidiaries — PC Express has
                    accumulated hundreds of thousands of repeat customers and billions in sales. Ever since its
                    inception, however, fees have been slowly increasing on the platform to help offset the rise in
                    operating costs.
                </p><br>
                <p>We learned from surveys that 32% of churned customers said their reason for leaving was due to high
                    fees. We had to bring them back, and so our challenge was: How might we reduce fees for our
                    customers, yet continue to build revenue to support the business?
                </p><br>
                <p>Introducing PC Express Pass: a subscription service for customers to receive $0 fees on regular
                    grocery pickup and delivery, and receive reduced fees on additional services such as Rapid Delivery
                    (with DoorDash), and deliveries within 3 hours.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    PC Express Pass went live in March 2023, and within 6 months, we've reached over 109,000 subscribers
                    at an over 21% conversion rate! It's clear customers really wanted to get rid of fees, and we've
                    been able to save them over $9M in fees thus far. The stat I'm most proud of is retention and
                    recurring purchases, as we've been able to increase retention year-over-year by over 10%!

                <p>One of the unseen catalysts for a need for a subscription program was the sunsetting of one that
                    already existed. PC Optimum Insiders (PCOI) has been around for years, and offered customers
                    benefits such as 10% back in points and free pickup with PC Express. The key thing it was missing?
                    Free delivery.

                    going up to $13.99 for orders within 3 hours. Though Delivery orders only accounted for 20% of
                    the
                    business, this was still a large market to address and a market that’s not being serviced by

                <p class="heading">Competitive subscription programs</p>
                <p>Let’s face it, there were a lot of delivery services before us doing subscriptions. Even we had a
                    subscription before our subscription…
                </p><br>
                <p>So we looked at examples such as Uber One, DashPass, and Instacart+ and saw they handled their
                    subscriptions very differently, yet there was a common theme across the three. They didn’t shy
                    away
                    from showing off their ads throughout the experience. Some play to the customer’s fear of regret
                    or
                    FOMO, with taglines like “you could save $X with {insert membership here}”. Their sign up
                    experiences were usually a one-click and done, aimed to get you into the program as easily as
                    possible. And lastly all three had a robust management process, with Uber One actually having
                    their cancellation process a bit more hidden. Instacart+ and Uber One also called out the
                    membership savings to try and stop you from even getting to the cancellation screen.

                    to
                    measure this against our business goals. A must-have for our new subscription service was
                    offering a
                    1-month free trial at launch. Knowing this, the core success metric I defined during the sprint
                    was:
                    the number of people that are subscribed, after free-trials have run out. Though this measured
                    success of the program in a vacuum, a true measure of success would be increased retention,
                    since
                    our core problem was churn.

                <p>Focusing on the first tenet, Discoverability, we knew one way to get customers’ attention was
                    through
                    ads. I called out that the most important parts of the experience to include these ads were at
                    timeslot selection and checkout, as this is where customers are most aware of the fees they’re
                    paying. At the same time, the end of the funnel shouldn’t be the first time they hear of this
                    program.

            <div class="text-section">
                <p>For the second tenet, I wanted to minimize the steps it took to sign up, so customers could get
                    back
                    to shopping for groceries. I designed the flow to be launched on-click of the ads throughout the
                    experience, and have the annual subscription pre-selected once that screen opens.
                </p><br>
                <p>Since this subscription would likely appeal most to existing, repeat customers, their credit card
                    information would be saved. Thus the resulting flow is simply tapping the ad and pressing sign
                    up to
                    continue. </p>

                <p>Lastly, for having a simple manage process, this primarily meant to make cancellation as easy as
                    possible. Since we expected all the information to be stored within the customer’s PC Express
                    profile (using their saved credit card), I designed the only function within the subscription
                    page
                    to be the cancellation button.

                <p>I usability tested the experience and found that even with high fees, customers didn’t notice the
                    ads
                    with the yellow branding. We amounted this to banner blindness, but also found that the yellow
                    wasn’t a high enough contrast to capture customers’ attention. We ended up choosing the deeper
                    red
                    because it felt closer to the PC Express red branding, and conversely had a higher contrast
                    compared
                    to the yellow.

                <p class="heading">Technical constraints </p>
                <p>So remember the second tenet I mentioned?
                </p><br>
                <p>This flow started to be questioned when we realized we couldn’t charge credit cards on a
                    recurring basis. Our current systems didn’t have the capability, so we had to use the same
                    third-party vendor that was used with PCOI in the past. Why didn’t we know this going in? Well
                    the
                    people that built PCOI weren’t involved in this engagement; something we learned way too late.
                    This
                    meant that customers would have to enter their credit card information
                    for the program to be stored in the third-party’s backend system, even if they frequently shop
                    with
                    PC Express and had a credit card saved.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    I think the worst part of the experience is the addition of the shipping
                    address fields, which don't make sense in the context of a fee-focused subscription program.
                    After
                    questioning the third-party, to see if we could get out of including this, we heard that this
                    was
                    necessary to ensure proper taxation of customers and to ensure they lived in Canada.</p>

            <div class="text-section">
                <p>Honestly I was upset with this approach. Now, even though I’m a frequent shopper of PC Express, I
                    was
                    also the designer, so I had to step back. What I found in usability testing was that none of the
                    participants
                    actually mentioned this as being a negative part of the experience when signing up — even after
                    being asked about
                    these form fields. After reporting this to our stakeholders, the business team concluded that
                    customers would likely still be
                    motivated enough to remove fees from the experience, even if it means to spend ~30 seconds to
                    enter
                    in their credit card details again. A learning from this challenge was, though a designed
                    experience
                    could be the best possible experience, it doesn’t necessarily mean an alternative direction is
                    the
                    opposite.
                </p><br>
                <p>This flow continued to expand in scope however, as new edge cases and customer account
                    permutations
                    became uncovered.

                <p class="heading">A ton of coordination</p>
                <p>As I mentioned, it all kicked off with a design sprint. Representatives from marketing, UX,
                    business, and development were all involved in the kick-off for the project, and I was the
                    primary product designer on the initiative until it’s launch, with assistance from my lead,
                    Allan. Though this seemed like a lot, this project then blew up to include heavy involvement
                    from legal, PC Financial, our third-party vendor, and more effort from marketing than we
                    initially imagined.
                </p><br>
                <p>Now, how was this a challenge? Well, how was it not? Finding calendar times, gaining alignment
                    from so many people on the smallest things, coordinating communications between legal teams,
                    marketing and UX teams, and much, much more.
                </p><br>
                <p>In retrospect, I don’t think there really is a way to solve for situations like this. Though
                    Loblaw Digital operates like a startup, it still is under the Loblaw parent company which
                    operates like not-a-startup… Large launches will require large engagements.

                <p class="heading">Learnings and takeaways</p>
                <p>I had to do a lot and wear a lot of hats on this project. This might be the least
                    UX-artifact-heavy project I’ve worked on, but somehow it felt like the most? I worked a ton with
                    our marketing teams because content was so important on a project like this. We always had to
                    make sure what they were sharing in ads and media matched what we were sharing in the experience
                    to our customers.
                </p><br>
                <p>Closely partnering with development was a must as well. We always had impromptu calls and deep
                    walkthroughs of flows and rules for things in the experience. Throwing in the third-party layer
                    as well, it brought us to empathize with each other as it was a service we were all new to and
                    had to learn.
                </p><br>
                <p>That stuff being said, I think my biggest learning was just working with a lot of different teams
                    and getting to know a lot of people. I made great friends on our marketing side after being down
                    and dirty in this project and I’m very thankful for it.
