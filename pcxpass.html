            <div class="text-section">
                <p>PC Express is Loblaws’ answer to a customer need for receiving groceries by ordering online. By
                    servicing the largest grocery chain in Canada — Loblaws and its subsidiaries — PC Express has
                    accumulated hundreds of thousands of repeat customers and billions in sales. Ever since its
                    inception, however, fees have been slowly increasing on the platform to help offset the rise in
                    operating costs.
                </p><br>
                <p>The problem was trivial: due to our high fee structure, customers were churning from our
                    platform to either shop in-store or shop at a competitor. And thus our challenge was: How might
                    we reduce fees for our customers, yet continue to build revenue to support the business?
                </p><br>
                <p>Introducing PC Express Pass: a subscription service for customers to receive $0 fees on regular
                    grocery pickup and delivery, and receive reduced fees on additional services such as Rapid
                    Delivery (with DoorDash), and immediacy deliveries (within 3 hours).
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    PC Express Pass went live in March 2023 and became available on both web and app, across almost
                    all of our banners. I worked on the program end-to-end; kicking off with a design sprint, then
                    conducting research into competitors, designing out the experience across web and app, and
                    working closely with development, business and marketing teams to get this out the door.

                <p>When we started this initiative, one of the success metrics I defined during our design sprint
                    was: the number of people that’d stay
                    subscribed, following the end of their free-trial. As of writing, we’re nearing 1 year of PC
                    Express Pass being live and I think it’s safe to say we blew that out of the water.

                <p>As an outcome of the design sprint, I worked with my design lead on defining the three parts of
                    the journey for PC Express Pass. We looked at what competitors, such as UberOne and Instacart+,
                    did in their experiences and narrowed it down to 3 core aspects: discovery, the core sign up
                    experience, and managing the subscription. We white boarded this and tried to define what the
                    experience would look like at all 3 stages, as well as what communications (i.e. emails) would
                    be part of each stage.

                <p>For each part of the stage, we had a tenet that we followed to hold us accountable and ensure we
                    were solving the right problems. Starting with discovery:

                <p><span class="heading">1. Ensuring that awareness was widespread of the
                        program.</span><br>
                    Customers needed to know throughout the
                    journey, and more specifically in cart and checkout, that they have a way around the fees.

                    If customers are about to purchase their groceries, we should
                    have a frictionless experience that reduces the deviation from that flow.

                    prioritized, which we later iterated on and included a survey to help our research team gain
                    rationale for cancellations.

                <p class="heading">Our first challenge: branding</p>
                <p>Though it felt like we had 90% of the work done after the sprint, we came to realize that our
                    branding and colours needed work. We saw in usability testing that customers did not notice our
                    ad units sprinkled throughout the experience (banner blindness); an assumption we had was the
                    yellow colour we were using was off-brand and didn’t capture enough attention. Working closely
                    with our branding and design teams, we aligned on a deep red to accent our existing brighter red
                    that we use so much throughout PC Express today. A learning from this challenge was to start
                    with more recognizable colours right off the bat, rather than going wide.

                    "how could we make this memorable for customers as they continue to use PC Express?" I used this
                    excessively when it came to ad units, especially on the modal that would appear on-entry for
                    non-subscribed customers. The goal across the board was to make sure customers were not signing
                    up because they didn't want to, rather than from lack of awareness.

                <p>So remember the second tenet I mentioned? Signing up had to be quick and easy. And we thought we
                    did that in the experience. The happy path flow was you’d open the sign up modal, select your
                    plan, click sign up and you’re in. For what that looks like in a gif, look below.

            </div>

            <div class="text-section">
                <p>Well this flow started to be questioned when we realized we couldn’t charge credit cards on a
                    recurring basis. As PC Express never had it’s own subscription program in the past, achieving
                    this would be a major lift, so we used a third-party vendor to help us. The customer impact?
                    Well this meant that customers would have to enter their credit card information for the program
                    to be stored in the third-party’s backend system, even if they used PC Express and already had a
                    credit card saved. This changed the flow that we’d designed by adding extra steps for customers
                    to complete.

                <p>Honestly I was very upset with this approach. This went against our second tenet of needing the
                    experience to be as simple as possible. Now, even though I’m a frequent shopper of PC Express, I
                    was also the designer, so I had to step back. What I found in usability testing is that no
                    customers actually mentioned this as being a negative part of the experience — even
                    when being asked about those form fields in the flow. What the business team concluded was
                    customers will likely still be motivated enough to remove fees from the experience, even if it
                    means to spend ~30 seconds to enter in their credit card details again. A learning from this
                    challenge was, though a designed experience could be the best possible experience, it doesn’t
                    necessarily mean an alternative is the opposite.
                </p><br>
                <p>This flow continued to expand in scope however, as new edge cases and customer account
                    permutations became uncovered. The final flow chart ended up looking like the following.

                <p class="heading">The final boss: a ton of coordination</p>
                <p>As I mentioned, it all kicked off with a design sprint. Representatives from marketing, UX,
                    business, and development were all involved in the kick-off for the project, and I was the
                    primary product designer on the initiative until it’s launch, with assistance from my lead,
                    Allan. Though this seemed like a lot, this project then blew up to include heavy involvement
                    from legal, PC Financial, our third-party vendor, and more effort from marketing than we
                    initially imagined.
                </p><br>
                <p>Now, how was this a challenge? Well, how was it not? Finding calendar times, gaining alignment
                    from so many people on the smallest things, coordinating communications between legal teams,
                    marketing and UX teams, and much, much more.
                </p><br>
                <p>In retrospect, I don’t think there really is a way to solve for situations like this. Though
                    Loblaw Digital operates like a startup, it still is under the Loblaw parent company which
                    operates like not-a-startup… Large launches will require large engagements.

                <p class="heading">Learnings and takeaways</p>
                <p>I had to do a lot and wear a lot of hats on this project. This might be the least
                    UX-artifact-heavy project I’ve worked on, but somehow it felt like the most? I worked a ton with
                    our marketing teams because content was so important on a project like this. We always had to
                    make sure what they were sharing in ads and media matched what we were sharing in the experience
                    to our customers.
                </p><br>
                <p>Closely partnering with development was a must as well. We always had impromptu calls and deep
                    walkthroughs of flows and rules for things in the experience. Throwing in the third-party layer
                    as well, it brought us to empathize with each other as it was a service we were all new to and
                    had to learn.
                </p><br>
                <p>That stuff being said, I think my biggest learning was just working with a lot of different teams
                    and getting to know a lot of people. I made great friends on our marketing side after being down
                    and dirty in this project and I’m very thankful for it.
