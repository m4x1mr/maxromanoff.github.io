                    High fees were causing many delivery customers to churn from PC Express to other grocery delivery
                    platforms. We were losing marketshare, and losing it quick.

                </div>
                <p> Put simply, PC Express is grocery e-commerce for Canada's largest grocery chain — Loblaws. Due to
                    it's huge reach, the service has accumulated hundreds of thousands of repeat customers and
                    billions in sales. Why would customers choose shopping on PC Express over a competitor? Aside from
                    in-store pricing and ~70% serviceability coverage of all Canadian households, PC Express offers
                    earning and redemption of PC Optimum points — Canada's most valuable loyalty program.
                </p><br>
                <p>As of today, PC Express offers pickup and delivery for groceries, and primarily has an
                    80/20 pickup-to-delivery ratio for orders. </p>

                </div>

                <p>You might be thinking: if it's so successful and the loyalty program is so good, why are customers
                    churning? The answer is high fees. When surveying existing customers, we heard that 11% mention high
                    fees as being one of the primary areas of improvement. In contrast, when surveying customers that
                    have recently churned from shopping with PC Express, 32% attributed their
                    reason for leaving PC Express as high fees.</p>

                <p>We took this opportunity into a design sprint. My design lead and I brought in folks from business,
                    design, strategy, and development to take part. Split across multiple days, we first started to
                    understand our competitors and what they did well, and what they did poorly. We used this to then
                    define our core KPIs that would measure success for the program. As a team we then started to
                    sketch, and what emerged were 3 key aspects of the customer journey. </p>

                    to 3

                    sign-up).
                    For each part of the stage, we had a tenet that we followed to hold us accountable and ensure we
                    were solving the right problems.

                </div>

                <p>Focusing on the first tenet, Discoverability, we knew one way to get customers’ attention was
                    through ads. I called out that the most important parts of the experience to include these ads were
                    at
                    timeslot selection and checkout, as this is where customers are most aware of the fees they’re
                    paying. At the same time, the end of the funnel shouldn’t be the first time they hear of this
                    program.
                </p>

                    <p class="heading">How might we create a frictionless sign up?</p>
                </div>


                <p>For the second tenet, I wanted to minimize the steps it took to sign up, so customers could get
                    back to shopping for groceries. I designed the flow to be launched on-click of the ads throughout
                    the
                    experience, and have the annual subscription pre-selected once that screen opens.
                </p><br>
                <p>Since this subscription would likely appeal most to existing, repeat customers, their credit card
                    information would be saved. Thus the resulting flow is simply tapping the ad and pressing sign
                    up to continue. </p>

                </div>
                <p>Though the sign up flow was lean, we heard that customers were having trouble learning what the
                    program was about. Maybe we were too lean. We
                    surfaced the value propositions for Pass in the sign up modal to help with comprehension.

                </div>
                <p>Lastly, for having a simple manage process, this primarily meant to make cancellation as easy as
                    possible. Since we expected all the information to be stored within the customer’s PC Express
                    profile (using their saved credit card), I designed the only functions within the subscription
                    page to be the option to switch plans and the cancellation button.

                    <br>
                    Unfortunately, we found out our frictionless sign up flow was about to get a lot of friction.

                </div>

                <p>Part way into tech discovery, our dev teams learned that our current payment systems didn’t have the
                    capability to charge credit cards on a recurring basis, so we had to use a
                    third-party vendor; something we learned way too late.
                    This meant that customers would have to enter their credit card information
                    for the program to be stored in the third-party’s backend system, even if they frequently shop
                    with PC Express and had a credit card saved in checkout.
                </p><br>
                <p> For tax reasons, we also had to ask for shipping address fields (bruh!), which doesn't make sense in
                    the context of a subscription... I designed and proposed a solution where we could use the
                    customer's saved addresses on file, to fast track them through the process.

                    Though I was upset with the approach, what I found after testing was that none of the participants
                    actually
                    mentioned this as being a negative part of the experience when signing up — even after
                    being asked about the form fields. After reporting this to our stakeholders, the business team
                    concluded that customers would likely still be motivated enough to remove fees from the experience,
                    even if it means to spend ~30 seconds to enter in their credit card details again.

                <p>
                    These changes impacted the management screens as well, as we had to store address and card details
                    there. Due to these changes in scope, we had to cut scope for launch, such as the savings
                    calculations and the ability to change plans post-sign-up (this was added back soon after launch).

                <p>Once the designs and value props were finalized, I worked closely with my PM to
                    define the email communications for PC Express Pass. We defined 4 email-templates to capture the
                    initial launch, confirmation of sign up, renewals, and cancellations. After the MVP launched, our
                    growth and graphic design teams worked to expand the marketing emails.
                </p><br>
                <p>The logic for the emails was simple: the initial launch email was set to go out to all PC Express
                    customers on the launch day, and just included a link to sign up and callouts for the value
                    propositions.
                    The confirmation email went out once a customer successfully signed up for the Pass; similarly, the
                    renewal email went out after a monthl or annual subscription renewed. The cancellation email went
                    out after a customer cancelled.

                <p>PC Express Pass went live in March 2023, and since then, we've accumulated over 109,000 subscribers
                    at an over 21% conversion rate. In total, we've been able to save customers over $9M in fees. For
                    our most important metric, being retention, we've observed a 10% increase in retention
                    year-over-year! And as expected, our best performing ad placement was in the latter half of the
                    funnel, specifically in cart.

                </div>
                <p>As I mentioned, it all kicked off with a design sprint. Representatives from marketing, UX,
                    business, and development were all involved in the kick-off for the project, and I was the
                    primary product designer on the initiative until it’s launch, with assistance from my lead,
                    Allan. Though this seemed like a lot, this project then blew up to include heavy involvement
                    from legal, PC Financial, our third-party vendor, and more effort from marketing than we
                    initially imagined.
                </p><br>
                <p>Now, how was this a challenge? Well, how was it not? Finding calendar times, gaining alignment
                    from so many people on the smallest things, coordinating communications between legal teams,
                    marketing and UX teams, and much, much more.
                </p><br>
                <p>In retrospect, I don’t think there really is a way to solve for situations like this. Though
                    Loblaw Digital operates like a startup, it still is under the Loblaw parent company which
                    operates like not-a-startup… Large launches will require large engagements.

                </div>
                <p>I had to do a lot and wear a lot of hats on this project. This might be the least
                    UX-artifact-heavy project I’ve worked on, but somehow it felt like the most? I worked a ton with
                    our marketing teams because content was so important on a project like this. We always had to
                    make sure what they were sharing in ads and media matched what we were sharing in the experience
                    to our customers.
                </p><br>
                <p>Closely partnering with development was a must as well. We always had impromptu calls and deep
                    walkthroughs of flows and rules for things in the experience. Throwing in the third-party layer
                    as well, it brought us to empathize with each other as it was a service we were all new to and
                    had to learn.
                </p><br>
                <p>That stuff being said, I think my biggest learning was just working with a lot of different teams
                    and getting to know a lot of people. I made great friends on our marketing side after being down
                    and dirty in this project and I’m very thankful for it.
