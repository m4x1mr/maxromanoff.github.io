                <p class="heading">TL;DR</p>
                <p>PC Express is a grocery e-commerce service for Canada’s largest grocery chain — Loblaws. Though the
                    service has hundreds of thousands of loyal customers and accrued billions in revenue, we’ve been
                    noticing churn amongst customers throughout 2022. After surveying these customers, we learned that
                    32% said their reason for leaving was due to high fees.
                </p><br>
                <p>To combat this problem, we launched PC Express Pass: a subscription service for customers to receive
                    $0 fees on regular grocery pickup and delivery, and receive reduced fees on additional services such
                    as Rapid Delivery (with DoorDash), and deliveries within 3 hours.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    PC Express Pass went live in March 2023, and within 6 months, we've reached over 109,000 subscribers
                    at an over 21% conversion rate! It's clear customers really wanted to get rid of fees, and we've
                    been able to save them over $9M in fees thus far. The stat I'm most proud of is retention and
                    recurring purchases, as we've been able to increase retention year-over-year by over 10%.

                <p> Put simply, PC Express is grocery e-commerce for Canada's largest grocery chain — Loblaws. Due to
                    it's huge reach, the service has accumulated hundreds of thousands of repeat customers and
                    billions in sales. Why would customers choose shopping on PC Express over a competitor? Aside from
                    in-store pricing and ~70% serviceability coverage of all Canadian households, PC Express offers
                    earning and redemption of PC Optimum points — Canada's most valuable loyalty program.
                </p><br>
                <p>As of today, PC Express offers pickup and delivery for groceries, and primarily has an
                    80/20 pickup-to-delivery ratio for orders. </p>

                <p class="heading">The problem: Churn</p>
                <p>You might be thinking: if it's so successful and the loyalty program is so good, why is the problem
                    titled "Churn"? One word: Fees. We learned from surveys that 32% of churned customers said their
                    reason for leaving PC Express was due to high fees.</p><br>
                <p>
                    Pickup fees have been relatively stable, however delivery fees have been increasing to account for
                    rising operational costs. For orders being delivered within the same day, delivery fees are $9.99,
                    and go up to $13.99 for orders within 3 hours.
                    For example, on a $50 grocery order, $14 in fees would account for almost 22% of the final total...
                    This was important for us to consider because 35% of our delivery customers place orders within
                    the same day or earlier.

                <p class="heading">Defining a subscription program</p>
                <p>From our research, the question we had to answer was: How might we reduce delivery fees for our most
                    loyal customers, yet still continue to earn revenue for PC Express?</p><br>
                <p>
                    Working with our stakeholders and the business, numerous ideas came up around dynamic pricing for
                    fees, as a percentage of the order value. The issue with these ideas was that they didn't solve for
                    the core problem: customers encountering fees much higher than competitors.
                </p><br>
                <p>What we proceeded with was a subscription program to remove fees. This would double-down on us
                    servicing our most loyal customers, as well as outline an additional revenue stream that would
                    supplement revenue lost from fees. </p>

                <p class="heading">Researching previous PC Express subscriptions</p>
                <p>One of the unseen catalysts for a need for a subscription program was that PC
                    Optimum Insiders was being shut down. PC Optimum Insiders (PCOI) has been around for years and
                    serviced all Loblaws-owned businesses through benefits such as 10% back in points on house-brand
                    products and free pickup (only) on PC Express. The key thing it was missing was free delivery.
                </p><br>
                <p>Many of our most loyal customers were PCOI members, and knowing how many of our customer base
                    prefers pickup over delivery, we knew that a future challenge would be to convince these customers
                    to
                    switch to the newer subscription service. (More details on challenges faced with this later).</p>

                <p class="heading">How competitors handled subscription programs</p>
                <p>Let’s face it, there were a lot of delivery services before us doing subscriptions. Even we had a
                    subscription before our subscription…
                </p><br>
                <p>So we looked at examples such as Uber One, DashPass, and Instacart+ and saw they handled their
                    subscriptions very differently, yet there was a common theme across the three. They didn’t shy
                    away
                    from showing off their ads throughout the experience. Some play to the customer’s fear of regret
                    or
                    FOMO, with taglines like “you could save $X with {insert membership here}”. Their sign up
                    experiences were usually a one-click and done, aimed to get you into the program as easily as
                    possible. And lastly all three had a robust management process, with Uber One actually having
                    their cancellation process a bit more hidden. Instacart+ and Uber One also called out the
                    membership savings to try and stop you from even getting to the cancellation screen.

                    offering a 1-month free trial at launch. Knowing this, the core success metric I defined during the
                    sprint
                    was: the number of people that are subscribed, after free-trials have run out. Though this measured

                <p>Focusing on the first tenet, Discoverability, we knew one way to get customers’ attention was
                    through ads. I called out that the most important parts of the experience to include these ads were
                    at
                    timeslot selection and checkout, as this is where customers are most aware of the fees they’re
                    paying. At the same time, the end of the funnel shouldn’t be the first time they hear of this
                    program.

                <p class="heading">Designing a fast sign up flow</p>
                <p>For the second tenet, I wanted to minimize the steps it took to sign up, so customers could get
                    back to shopping for groceries. I designed the flow to be launched on-click of the ads throughout
                    the
                    experience, and have the annual subscription pre-selected once that screen opens.
                </p><br>
                <p>Since this subscription would likely appeal most to existing, repeat customers, their credit card
                    information would be saved. Thus the resulting flow is simply tapping the ad and pressing sign
                    up to continue. </p>

            </div>

            <div class="text-section">
                <p>With the first flow, I really focused on reducing decisions a customer could make and focused on
                    pushing customers to convert (through a free trial). Through feedback from stakeholders however,
                    they brought up good points around showing the plan types to let customers make decisions easier.
                    Another piece of feedback we heard was that we should better explain the benefits of the program,
                    and use the space on the screen to list out the value propositions. I made edits and started to
                    iterate on more final designs for the sign up journey.</p>

                <p>Lastly, for having a simple manage process, this primarily meant to make cancellation as easy as
                    possible. Since we expected all the information to be stored within the customer’s PC Express
                    profile (using their saved credit card), I designed the only functions within the subscription
                    page
                    to be the option to switch plans and the cancellation button.

                <p>Though the flow was simple enough, we still put it through usability testing to gather customer
                    feedback on the value propositions, the program, and if they knew how to sign up and cancel a
                    subscription. The most interesting part of the studies was that customers did not notice the
                    branding throughout the experience at all. Even when asked about the "yellow ads", customers did not
                    recall seeing them.

                <p>We amounted this to banner blindness, but also found that the yellow
                    wasn’t a high enough contrast to capture customers’ attention. We ended up choosing the deeper
                    red because it felt closer to the PC Express red branding, and conversely had a higher contrast
                    compared

                <p class="heading">Technical constraints: third-party vendor</p>
                <p>So remember the second tenet I mentioned?
                </p><br>
                <p>The sign up flow started to be questioned when we realized we couldn’t charge credit cards on a
                    recurring basis. Our current payment systems didn’t have the capability, so we had to use the same
                    third-party vendor that was used with PCOI. Why didn’t we know this going in? Well
                    the people that built PCOI weren’t involved in this engagement; something we learned way too late.
                    This meant that customers would have to enter their credit card information
                    for the program to be stored in the third-party’s backend system, even if they frequently shop
                    with PC Express and had a credit card saved.
                </p><br>
                <p>
                    I think the worst part of the experience is the addition of the shipping
                    address fields, which don't make sense in the context of a fee-focused subscription program (the
                    third-party needed it for tax purposes). I designed and proposed a solution where we could use the
                    customer's saved addresses on file, to fast track them through the process. Unfortunately, we
                    couldn't proceed with this solution because the third-party has no way of knowing what addresses are
                    saved to a customer's account.

            <div class="text-section">
                <p>I was upset with this approach, so I launched a quick unmoderated test with customers to gather
                    feedback focused on the sign up process. What I found was that none of the participants actually
                    mentioned this as being a negative part of the experience when signing up — even after
                    being asked about the form fields. After reporting this to our stakeholders, the business team
                    concluded that customers would likely still be motivated enough to remove fees from the experience,
                    even if it means to spend ~30 seconds to enter in their credit card details again.

                <p>Since we were using the same third-party that the PCOI program was using, our developers told us that
                    signing up for PC Express Pass with an account with a PCOI subscription would forfeit it in favour
                    of PC Express Pass, and that a customer couldn't have both. That was mindblowing! After reviewing
                    this with our legal team, we all felt it was necessary to include additional steps to let customers
                    know they were giving up their subscriptions. The primary piece of feedback was that we needed a
                    checklist format, and clear copy to communicate that they're giving up the PCOI subscription.

                <p>PC Express Pass went live in March 2023, and within 6 months, we reached over 109,000 subscribers

                    our most important metric, being retention, we've observed a 10% increase in retention
                    year-over-year! And as expected, our best performing ad placement was in the latter half of the
                    funnel, specifically in cart.

                <p class="heading">A ton of coordination</p>
                <p>As I mentioned, it all kicked off with a design sprint. Representatives from marketing, UX,
                    business, and development were all involved in the kick-off for the project, and I was the
                    primary product designer on the initiative until it’s launch, with assistance from my lead,
                    Allan. Though this seemed like a lot, this project then blew up to include heavy involvement
                    from legal, PC Financial, our third-party vendor, and more effort from marketing than we
                    initially imagined.
                </p><br>
                <p>Now, how was this a challenge? Well, how was it not? Finding calendar times, gaining alignment
                    from so many people on the smallest things, coordinating communications between legal teams,
                    marketing and UX teams, and much, much more.
                </p><br>
                <p>In retrospect, I don’t think there really is a way to solve for situations like this. Though
                    Loblaw Digital operates like a startup, it still is under the Loblaw parent company which
                    operates like not-a-startup… Large launches will require large engagements.

                <p class="heading">Learnings and takeaways</p>
                <p>I had to do a lot and wear a lot of hats on this project. This might be the least
                    UX-artifact-heavy project I’ve worked on, but somehow it felt like the most? I worked a ton with
                    our marketing teams because content was so important on a project like this. We always had to
                    make sure what they were sharing in ads and media matched what we were sharing in the experience
                    to our customers.
                </p><br>
                <p>Closely partnering with development was a must as well. We always had impromptu calls and deep
                    walkthroughs of flows and rules for things in the experience. Throwing in the third-party layer
                    as well, it brought us to empathize with each other as it was a service we were all new to and
                    had to learn.
                </p><br>
                <p>That stuff being said, I think my biggest learning was just working with a lot of different teams
                    and getting to know a lot of people. I made great friends on our marketing side after being down
                    and dirty in this project and I’m very thankful for it.
