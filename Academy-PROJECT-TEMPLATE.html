                    While working with Academy, I helped with designing the UX throughout the app. Though I worked with
                    a team on defining the architecture, user flows, and designing the visuals, one of my
                    responsibilities was also owning the usability testing aspect.

                The initial release for the app was an MVP, so we worked closely with the lead designer at Academy to
                ensure the experience closely mirrored their website’s capabilities. Despite that, the Sapient team
                pushed for a few app specific features to drive engagement, over the website.

                    <br>
                    As part of Academy's initial research that they brought to us, we knew that Convenience Chasers were
                    a large segment. As such, we had to prioritize getting online-purchased products in the hands of
                    this group, faster. Working with our product team, we found that delivering a seamless curbside and
                    buy online, pick up in store experience was imperative. I worked with the lead designer from Academy
                    to understand the current state of picking up online orders, both curbside and in-store, and
                    designed the flows for both of these experiences. I also worked on designing the Apple wallet card
                    that a user could scan to verify their purchase.

                    How might we help Value Verifiers learn more about in-store products?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Though shopping in-store has its benefits, there are drawbacks such as not knowing how a product is
                    reviewed or if there are any deals going on. This is a very real problem to the Value Verifier
                    segment which looks to get the most bang-for-their-buck. One way of solving such an issue is
                    bringing the online-store with them, and thus allowing users to scan a product’s barcode and see
                    more details about it online. I worked on the layout for the product description page and
                    collaborated with another designer on the flow for this use case.

                    <br>
                    Being a segment that purchases only the best of the best, Passion Pursuers need the flexibility to
                    return items, in case things don’t end up going as planned. Having to keep track of paper receipts,
                    website purchases, and orders on an app could be complicated, so we designed a way to keep all
                    orders in a single place, under a user’s account. Though this feature was a larger team effort, I
                    worked on the flows for a user adding a store receipt to their account, as well as the order details
                    pages.

                tens of thousands in revenue, in just a few weeks.

                    I was exposed to consumer research, design research, UI design, marketing, business, and video
                    editing all while working in a startup environment for 4 months. This was the first time I've been
                    exposed to Lean Startup within the workplace and working so quickly and iteratively. It was also
                    exciting working with so many people higher up in the organization and seeing how many different
                    teams this type of project brings together.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Before working on this team, this is something I would’ve never expected from a large company. Being
                    able to basically “wing-it” when it came to our methods of problem solving compared to having a
                    systemic way of going about a process is refreshing. I also loved the fact that everyday was spent
                    working on something different. One day I could be doing only UI, and the next, I could be working
                    on strategy and help identify issues that could seriously affect the final product. It definitely
                    wasn't dull, and gets me excited to work in something mixed in strategy and design.
