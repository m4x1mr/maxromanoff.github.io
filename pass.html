                    Aside from being one of the few companies that didn‚Äôt offer a subscription service, one of our
                    biggest pain points from customers were high fees. We had a clear opportunity to both develop a new
                    revenue stream for the PC Express business and address a customer problem.

                    Along with partners from the business, marketing, design, and development side, I took part in a
                    week-long design sprint to align on what this subscription pass could look like. Before designing,
                    we defined the key metrics to success for the subscription ‚Äî of which increasing retention was the
                    most voted on (after the free-trial period).

                    I worked with my manager and a few developers to define the key flows for PC Express Pass. At a high
                    level, we‚Äôd defined it as 3 parts: Discovery of the subscription service, the Core Experience of
                    signing up and having the pass, and the Managing of the subscription. When defining this, we
                    expected a large part of this experience to be ads for discovery, and a short and simple experience
                    for signing up for the pass.

                    As we had more presentations with dev teams, we learned more about how challenging it‚Äôd be to launch
                    a subscription. We needed to use a 3rd party to help us solve this, and thus, our ‚Äúshort and simple‚Äù
                    flow ballooned to something more‚Ä¶ I led weekly connects with our dev teams (both app and web) to
                    iteratively work through these flows and identify what other surprises could come up.
                    <br><br>
                    Though I was very upset with the changes to our existing simple flow, we put this in front of a few
                    customers in a usability test and no one had commented on the length of the flow and all
                    participants were able to complete the flow. It became a lesson in, what might be frowned on
                    design-wise, might not make as big of a deal for customers‚Ä¶ Though this doesn‚Äôt mean we shouldn‚Äôt
                    strive for the best experience.

                    Before launch, we scrambled to UAT the solution on all platforms to make sure we caught all the bugs
                    and it worked as expected all regions in Canada. And when it did launch, I remember how loud the
                    office was and how excited everyone was, just eyes glued to the Slack channel for updates in sign up
                    numbers.

                    Collaborating with diverse teams, we tackled high fees, shaped a user-centric flow, and overcame
                    technical hurdles. Through usability testing and rigorous platform checks, we achieved an 11%
                    conversion rate and a 10% YoY boost in retention. This experience emphasized the importance of
