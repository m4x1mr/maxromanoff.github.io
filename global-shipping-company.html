            <h2>The lack of visibility into one‚Äôs own supply chain can be catastrophic for business. In a field where
                being early is just as bad as being late, companies require the means to see where their shipments are,
                and make decisions accordingly. Throughout this engagement, we worked with our client to help them
                design and strategize around their supply chain management platform.

                    Though I wore many hats throughout this project, my primary focus was on the design strategy and
                    research for the platform. I worked closely with the Associate Creative Director (ACD) on the
                    project to gather input from our client‚Äôs customers, synthesize and present this research, and
                    facilitate workshops to define and prioritize future efforts at the portfolio level.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In addition to gathering research for our designs, we worked on trying to instil a repeatable
                    process that considered the qualitative aspect of customer research, rather than just quantitative
                    using analytics. What we‚Äôd found was that the existing process focused on delivering value ‚Äî with
                    the assumption that this also addressed customer problems ‚Äî and circumvented early-stage generative
                    and evaluative research to identify problems. This caused inefficiencies and a few instances of
                    rework as some customers were only asked for feedback once certain features were in development.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    We worked with the client to identify these inefficiencies and helped with defining an approach to
                    gather generative and evaluative research from their customers. I worked on defining what we wanted
                    to learn, assisted our client with facilitating these interviews, and synthesized our findings. We
                    then worked with them to facilitate a workshop to prioritize next steps.
