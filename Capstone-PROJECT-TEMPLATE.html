                <p>
                    Within Ontario’s healthcare system, there is a lot of variability when it comes to how patient data
                    is collected. The styles of reports not only vary across medical treatments, but also across
                    healthcare facilities, and are also subject to vary across how physicians fill out the reports — in
                    some cases, this is done with voice transcription. Though variability is not an issue with one-time
                    visitors, this does become an issue with patients with chronic diseases, such as cancer. Synoptic
                    reporting aims to solve this variability by having each healthcare facility use a single set of
                    reporting standards. This leads to more accurate reporting, reduced omissions and better knowledge
                    transfer — all of which are crucial when dealing with chronic diseases.

                    <br>
                    To ensure that reports are concise, the CCO team requires a large panel of doctors — called the
                    Working Group — to vote on which questions to include. Between the size of the Working Group, the
                    busy schedules of the doctors, and the amount of contentious questions that need to be resolved, the
                    development time can take quite a while.

                    I worked on an interview script to learn more about the people involved in the
                    development process. We found that there are three primary personas, two being from the CCO team
                    working in different capacities — the Functional Lead and a team member, and one being a member of
                    the Working Group — a clinician. As the clinicians had really busy schedules, we had to build that
                    persona based on data we received from the CCO team.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, we found that the existing process was very manual and decentralized. The Functional Lead
                    would
                    gather a giant set of questions from different reporting standards using Excel, and then convert
                    this to Word for clinicians to vote on the questions, and then consolidate the results by reverting
                    back to Excel. Once the questions were decided on, members of the CCO team would be required to
                    encode the resultant form into XML (a large work effort, as we later discovered).

                    handling different file types. Once a form is finalized, a CCO team member would be able to export
                    the form into XML, to be turned into a synoptic report.

                    I created the test protocol for both the Functional Lead and the Working Group members. As this was
                    a first glance into our designs, for both primary users, the in-test questions were focused around
                    “what would you expect to be able to do from this page”, rather than a task-based test. With the
                    Working Group members, we also asked additional questions to understand if their busy schedules
                    hindered their voting.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Overall, our test demonstrated that users saw value in the web-app concept, however we learned
                    that the platform was missing a few crucial features. The Functional Lead mentioned that the voting
                    results page was missing elements that she would typically use to identify contentious questions and
                    the Working Group mentioned wanting a save feature as they often return to voting at a later
                    time. One interesting finding we heard from both users was that it’d be helpful to include
                    instructions for the clinicians, written by the Functional Lead. We learned this was
                    commonly done inside of a Word doc, and typically just mentioned the type of report and the number
                    of questions.

                    the parent questions, rather than always, and child questions are simply displayed through the
                    numbering, rather than the redundancy of the box, arrow and numbering.

                    Starting off with the research, I was overwhelmed with the amount of problems that CCO faced in
                    their line of work. This led us to being unsure about the scope as we were typically used to
                    problems being handed to us, along with a clear expectation of the final outcome(s). The discovery
                    of the main pain points required a lot of deliberation between us, and everything had to be
                    considered to ensure we could actually deliver something within our limited time-frame; lots of
                    scope narrowing and refinement had to be done.

                    Looking at the design process, I found that small details in the prototypes were often crucial,
                    especially when working with people as meticulous as doctors. I learned from our mistakes of using
                    Lorem Ipsum for filler text because doctors became confused as they have never been exposed to that.
                    In addition, some of our prototypes looked realistic to the point that it was difficult for some

                    designing and when presenting designs (even if they’re prototypes), as this may affect the research
                    and results you’re gathering.
